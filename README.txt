/* ReadMefacial_projectionMappingCreated by Chia Yang Chang07/05/2020www.andrewtw.comThis program is using ofxFaceTrackers2 , ofxKinectProjectorToolkit addons. Through computer vision facial Detection / Recognition capture the facial structure and the human face area , projecting on another user with Kinect depth cam in the dark area.Using this this program you need a Kinect and a projector.The size of the second screen suggest to be set 1280*720.More details check the ofxKinectProjectorToolkits README.https://github.com/genekogan/ofxKinectProjectorToolkitOpenCv contourFinder will calculate the object within the threshold that we set.Therefore, this program will calculate the contourFinder box top centre, and we can mapping the face area location. After mapping the location, the program will find different height object face approximately location. (Still testing so it might not be that accurate, the location can still be adjust by OSC)//--------------------------------------------------------------In this package has a osc file can use TouchOSC editor to sync the controller, or you can use the GUI code preserve in the code.The OSC controller has two templates, the debug mode and filter mode. Debug have 7 functions that you can use 1. Debug button : Draw the face Mesh wireframe.2. CamActive: Turn off the grabber update.3. FT: Setting Kinect farThreshold parameter.4. A: Adjust the position of the projection area’s Y float.5. A2: Adjust the position of the projection area’s X float.6. X: Adjust the position of the projection area’s width.7. Y: Adjust the position of the projection area’s Height.Filter mode have three mode that you can select 1.Displace  2.Delaunay  3.Particles<Displace mode> parameter will change by the left sliders,Movement will adjust how big it will move.<Particles> parameter will change by the right sliders,Amount will add how many random particles,Dist will connect the particles within the distance we set.//--------------------------------------------------------------Addons:This program is using these addons,#include "ofxGui.h"#include "ofxFaceTracker2.h"#include "ofxOpenCv.h"#include "ofxCv.h"#include "ofxKinect.h"#include "ofxKinectProjectorToolkit.h"#include "ofxSecondWindow.h"#include "ofxPS3EyeGrabber.h"#include "ofxOsc.h"#include "ofxDelaunay.h"ofxPS3EyeGrabber is not necessary to use.//--------------------------------------------------------------Reference:Some part of this program’s code is reference from:Lewis Lepton - openFrameworks tutorial series - episode 060 - constellation controlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBkvusKre8Q&t=1sgenekogan – ofxKinectProjectorToolkithttps://github.com/genekogan/ofxKinectProjectorToolkitHalfdanJ - ofxFaceTracker2https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ofxFaceTracker2kylemcdonald – ofxFaceTrackerhttps://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTrackerThe Facial Computer vision concept thanks kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologieshttps://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/Week-2*/.
